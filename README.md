## 🌟 Key Features

### 📜 1. Online Quests (Gen 2 port — in progress)
- The original Gen 1 quest content (**"Magnemite Repair"** co-op quest, **"Bye Bye Butterfree"** solo quest, and their in-world NPCs/items) was **removed during the Gen 2 migration**.
- The mod now ships a **registry skeleton** (`quests/init.lua` and `npcs/init.lua`) with a clean registration API designed for Gen 2, ready to be filled back in with quest definitions and NPCs.
- The server-side quest engine (`QUEST_DEFINITIONS` / `QuestManager` in `gts_server.py`, plus the `quest_get` / `quest_accept` / `quest_pickup` / `quest_turn_in` endpoints) is untouched and ready to serve the re-added content.
- **Quest Log UI**: not yet reimplemented for Gen 2.

## 🛠️ Installation & Setup

1. Place the `gen1online-plus` mod folder into your `mods/` directory:
   ```
   pokemon-gen1-recomp/mods/gen1online-plus/
   ```
2. **Server files are NOT part of the mod zip.** They live in a separate `server/gen1online/` folder
   (outside the mod directory) so they are never distributed to players. The mod zip contains only the
   client code — it carries **no** player database, tokens, or server secrets.
3. **Configure the admin key** (required before first start):
   ```bash
   cd server/gen1online
   python -c "import secrets; print(secrets.token_hex(16))"   # pick a long random key
   ```
   Save it in `server_secrets.json` next to `gts_server.py`:
   ```json
   { "adminKey": "PASTE_YOUR_RANDOM_KEY_HERE" }
   ```
4. Start the server (binds to `127.0.0.1` by default — it is never exposed directly):
   ```bash
   python gts_server.py
   ```
5. (Recommended for playing with friends) Expose it through a Cloudflare tunnel so your public IP stays hidden:
   ```bash
   cloudflared tunnel --url http://127.0.0.1:7779
   ```
   Give your friends the `https://<random>.trycloudflare.com/` URL.
6. In *Pokémon Crystal Recomp*, press **`START`** → Select **`CONNECT TO SERVER`**.
7. Walk up to any online trainer, face them, and press **`A`** to challenge them to PVP or trade.

## 🔒 Server Security (Read This!)

- **The server binds to `127.0.0.1` only.** Never change this to `0.0.0.0` unless you fully
  understand the risk — an open port lets anyone on the internet reach your server and your PC.
- **Use `cloudflared` (or similar) as the only way in.** The tunnel forwards the public URL to
  localhost, so your home IP address is never revealed to players.
- **The admin key is your master password.** `admin_action` requests (ban / unban / remove / audit)
  are rejected with `403 FORBIDDEN` without it. Admin commands are run from the host machine:
  ```bash
  python gts_admin.py list
  python gts_admin.py ban 123456 "cheating"
  python gts_admin.py audit
  ```
  `gts_admin.py` reads the key from `server_secrets.json` automatically.
- **Recovery tokens are secret.** Every account has a token that can restore the save. A leaked token
  lets someone take over that account, so never share your token and never upload
  `server_secrets.json`, `gts_database.json`, `players_backup.json`, or `private_ip_ledger.json`.
- **Tokens are now 128-bit** for new accounts; legacy 8-character tokens remain valid.
- The IP audit ledger (`private_ip_ledger.json`) is stored only on the host for ban enforcement — it is
  never exposed through the API.
